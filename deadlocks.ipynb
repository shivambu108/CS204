    "### 1. Understanding Deadlocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A deadlock is a situation in a multiprogramming environment where a set of processes are permanently blocked because each process is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause. Typically, this waiting is for a resource (like a printer, memory, or a semaphore) that is currently held by another process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustrative Example:**  \n",
    "The chapter uses a law about trains at a crossing: if two trains meet and both must stop, neither will proceed until the other clears the track—illustrating the standstill characteristic of a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The System Model and Resource Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finite Resources:**  \n",
    "- **Resource Types and Instances:** The system is modeled as having a finite number of resources (e.g., CPUs, printers, files). Resources are grouped into classes where each instance in the class is considered equivalent. For instance, if a system has two printers that are interchangeable, they belong to the same resource class.\n",
    "- **Allocation Tracking:** The operating system maintains a table to track which resources are free and which are allocated, as well as which process holds a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Resource Usage Sequence:**  \n",
    "Processes follow a three-step protocol for resource usage:\n",
    "1. **Request:** A process must request a resource before using it. If the resource isn’t immediately available (because it’s held by another process), the requesting process waits.\n",
    "2. **Use:** Once the resource is allocated, the process can use it.\n",
    "3. **Release:** After using the resource, the process releases it so that it may be allocated to other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Formation of Deadlocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Circular Waiting:**  \n",
    "A deadlock occurs when every process in a group holds at least one resource and is waiting for another resource held by another process in the same group. The key aspect here is that no process can proceed unless a resource is freed, but each process is waiting on someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples Provided:**  \n",
    "- **Same Resource Type:** In a scenario with three CD RW drives and three processes, if each process holds one drive and requests another, all processes end up waiting indefinitely.\n",
    "- **Different Resource Types:** Consider a system with one printer and one DVD drive. If one process holds the DVD drive and requests the printer while another process holds the printer and requests the DVD drive, neither process can proceed—resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The Broader Context and Impact on System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming Responsibility vs. OS Intervention:**  \n",
    "While operating systems can implement methods to detect or recover from deadlocks, it is usually the programmer’s responsibility to design systems and multithreaded applications in a way that avoids them. Tools like semaphores and mutex locks—although they help manage race conditions—can inadvertently lead to deadlocks if locks are not acquired and released in a carefully planned order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Trends Increasing Deadlock Risk:**  \n",
    "The chapter points out that as systems grow more complex—with more processes, more threads, and longer-running services—the risk of encountering deadlocks increases. This means that careful resource management and synchronization design are even more critical in modern computing environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Deadlock Prevention and Avoidance Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prevention and Avoidance Techniques:**  \n",
    "The chapter hints at several approaches for handling deadlocks:\n",
    "- **Prevention:** Designing the system in a way that deadlock conditions are structurally impossible. For example, ensuring that processes request all required resources at once.\n",
    "- **Avoidance:** Dynamically analyzing resource-allocation states to ensure that a circular wait never occurs.\n",
    "- **Detection and Recovery:** Allowing deadlocks to occur but having mechanisms in place to detect them and recover by terminating or rolling back one or more processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these strategies are part of the overall discussion, the chapter emphasizes that, in practice, many operating systems leave it up to the application developers to manage deadlock risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the chapter on deadlocks covers:\n",
    "- **What deadlocks are:** Situations where processes are permanently waiting on each other for resource release.\n",
    "- **How resources are managed:** Finite resource availability, the classification of resources, and the standard protocol (request-use-release).\n",
    "- **How deadlocks occur:** Through circular waiting, demonstrated with both single-resource-type and multi-resource-type examples.\n",
    "- **The implications for system and program design:** Deadlocks are especially critical in environments with multithreaded or long-lived processes, making it essential for developers to be aware of proper lock management and resource allocation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed breakdown should give you a comprehensive understanding of the chapter’s key points on deadlocks, their causes, and their impact on operating system design and programming practices."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Mutual Exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Mutual exclusion means that at least one resource is non-shareable—only one process can use that resource at any given time. If another process requests it, the request must wait until the resource is released.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Imagine a printer in an office. When one process is printing, no other process can use the same printer simultaneously. Thus, if two processes try to print at the same time, one must wait until the other finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Hold and Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "In the hold and wait condition, a process is holding at least one resource while it waits to acquire additional resources that are currently allocated to other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Consider a process that holds a file lock and then requests access to a printer. If the printer is busy with another process, the first process continues holding the file lock while waiting for the printer. This overlap of holding one resource and waiting for another can contribute to a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. No Preemption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "No preemption means that a resource cannot be forcibly removed from a process holding it; the process must voluntarily release the resource once its task is complete. In other words, the operating system cannot take the resource away to break a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Imagine a process holding a lock on a critical data structure. Even if another process could use that data structure to move forward, the operating system cannot simply reassign the lock—it must wait for the process to release it. This non-interruptible control over resources is what we call \"no preemption.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Circular Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Circular wait is the condition where a closed chain of processes exists, such that each process holds at least one resource that the next process in the chain is waiting for. This creates a loop where no process can proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another in the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Consider three processes:\n",
    "- Process P0 holds Resource A and waits for Resource B.\n",
    "- Process P1 holds Resource B and waits for Resource C.\n",
    "- Process P2 holds Resource C and waits for Resource A.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this circular chain, none of the processes can continue because each one is waiting for a resource that is locked by another process in the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock can occur in a system only when all four conditions—mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait—occur simultaneously. These conditions illustrate why careful resource management and proper synchronization protocols are essential in operating systems and concurrent programming. By understanding and mitigating these conditions, developers can design systems that either prevent deadlocks from occurring or can detect and resolve them if they do.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Overview of the Resource-Allocation Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A resource-allocation graph is a directed graph used to model the allocation and request of resources in a system. It is a powerful tool for analyzing deadlock situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vertices (Nodes):**  \n",
    "   - **Processes (P):** Represented as circles (e.g., P1, P2, P3). These are the active processes in the system.\n",
    "   - **Resource Types (R):** Represented as rectangles (e.g., R1, R2, R3, R4). Each rectangle can contain multiple dots, with each dot representing an instance of that resource type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edges:**  \n",
    "   - **Request Edge (Pi → Rj):** Indicates that process Pi is requesting an instance of resource type Rj and is currently waiting for it.\n",
    "   - **Assignment Edge (Rj → Pi):** Indicates that an instance of resource type Rj has been allocated to process Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a process makes a request, a request edge is added. Once the request is granted, the edge is converted into an assignment edge. When a process releases the resource, the corresponding assignment edge is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Graph Represents Resource Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Instances:**  \n",
    "  Each resource type can have one or more instances. For example, if resource R2 has two instances, this is visually represented by two dots inside the rectangle for R2. This detail is important when analyzing cycles, as the availability of multiple instances can affect whether a cycle actually implies deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process States via the Graph:**  \n",
    "  The graph not only shows which resources are allocated and requested but also helps to visualize the state of each process. For instance, if a process has an assignment edge from one resource and a request edge to another, it indicates the process is currently holding a resource while waiting for another.\n",
    "\n",

    "   If the graph contains no cycles, then no process is deadlocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cycles May Imply Deadlock:**  \n",
    "   - **Single Instance Per Resource:** If every resource type has exactly one instance, then the presence of a cycle in the graph is both a necessary and sufficient condition for a deadlock.  \n",
    "   - **Multiple Instances Per Resource:** When resource types have multiple instances, a cycle in the graph is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a deadlock. This means that even if a cycle exists, it is possible that some process can eventually acquire the needed resource, breaking the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrative Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example with Deadlock (Figure 7.2):**  \n",
    "   Suppose we start with a graph where:\n",
    "   - **Process States:**  \n",
    "     - P1 holds an instance of R2 and waits for R1.\n",
    "     - P2 holds instances of R1 and R2 and waits for R3.\n",
    "     - P3 holds an instance of R3.\n",
    "   - **New Request:**  \n",
    "     If P3 now requests an instance of R2 and none is available, a new request edge (P3 → R2) is added.  \n",
    "   - **Cycle Formation:**  \n",
    "     Two cycles appear:\n",
    "     - Cycle 1: P1 → R1 → P2 → R3 → P3 → R2 → P1  \n",
    "     - Cycle 2: P2 → R3 → P3 → R2 → P2  \n",
    "   Since each process in these cycles is waiting for a resource held by another process in the cycle, all involved processes are deadlocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example with a Cycle But No Deadlock (Figure 7.3):**  \n",
    "   In another graph:\n",
    "   - A cycle exists: P1 → R1 → P3 → R2 → P1.  \n",
    "   - However, process P4 holds an instance of R2 that it may release. Once P4 releases the resource, it can be allocated to P3, breaking the cycle.  \n",

    "2. **Detection and Recovery:** Allow deadlocks to occur but then detect them and take corrective action.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many general-purpose operating systems—such as Linux and Windows—follow the third approach, leaving the burden of handling deadlocks to application developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Deadlock Prevention and Avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadlock Prevention**  \n",
    "- **Core Idea:** Prevent deadlocks by structurally ensuring that one or more of the necessary conditions for deadlock (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait) cannot occur.\n",
    "- **Techniques:**  \n",
    "  - **Eliminating Hold-and-Wait:** For instance, forcing processes to request all required resources at once.\n",
    "  - **Resource Preemption:** Allowing the system to forcibly take resources away from a process.\n",
    "  - **Imposing an Ordering:** Enforcing a strict order in which resources must be requested to avoid circular waiting.\n",
    "- **Advantages and Limitations:**  \n",
    "  - Prevention methods are robust because they guarantee that a deadlock will never occur.  \n",
    "  - However, they can be overly restrictive and may reduce system efficiency by forcing processes to hold resources longer or by complicating resource-allocation logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadlock Avoidance**  \n",
    "- **Core Idea:** Instead of outright forbidding the conditions for deadlock, the operating system is provided with extra information about future resource requests. Using this information, the system can decide whether granting a particular resource request might lead to an unsafe state.\n",
    "- **Example Technique:**  \n",
    "  - **Banker’s Algorithm:** This algorithm simulates resource allocation for each new request and only grants the request if it determines that the system can still allocate resources to all processes in some safe order.\n",
    "- **Advantages and Limitations:**  \n",
    "  - Avoidance allows more flexibility than prevention because it only blocks those requests that would lead to an unsafe state.\n",
    "  - It requires the processes to declare in advance the maximum resources they might need, which isn’t always feasible.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Deadlock Detection and Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadlock Detection**  \n",

    "- **Detection Methods:**  \n",
    "  - **Cycle Detection in the Resource-Allocation Graph:** If a cycle is found (especially in systems with single-instance resources), a deadlock is indicated.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Recovery Techniques**  \n",
    "- **Process Termination:** Once a deadlock is detected, one or more processes can be terminated (rolled back) to break the cycle.\n",
    "- **Resource Preemption:** Resources may be forcibly reallocated from some processes to others to resolve the deadlock.\n",
    "- **Considerations:**  \n",
    "  - Recovery may involve “killing” processes or rolling back transactions, both of which can be disruptive.\n",
    "  - It might be challenging to determine which process to terminate without causing significant system performance issues.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ignoring Deadlocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:**  \n",
    "- **Philosophy:** Many systems choose to ignore deadlocks altogether, based on the assumption that deadlocks occur so infrequently (perhaps once a year) that the cost of implementing prevention or detection and recovery mechanisms is not justified.\n",
    "- **Real-World Implementation:**  \n",
    "  - Operating systems like Linux and Windows largely adopt this approach.\n",
    "  - Instead, the onus falls on application developers to design their software in a way that avoids deadlocks.\n",
    "- **Advantages and Limitations:**  \n",
    "  - Ignorance reduces the overhead and complexity in the operating system.\n",
    "  - However, if a deadlock does occur, the system may become unresponsive, and manual intervention (or application-level recovery mechanisms) is required.\n",

    "### Combining Approaches\n",

    "- **Tailoring Solutions:**  \n",

    "- **Hybrid Systems:**  \n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, handling deadlocks involves trade-offs between system overhead, performance, and complexity:\n",
    "- **Prevention/Avoidance** methods aim to stop deadlocks from occurring by enforcing strict resource-allocation rules or using predictive algorithms.\n",
    "- **Detection and Recovery** approaches accept that deadlocks may happen and focus on identifying and resolving them post-factum.\n",

    "### Overview of Deadlock Prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock prevention works by ensuring that at least one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock cannot occur. Recall that for a deadlock to arise, the following conditions must hold simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutual Exclusion**\n",
    "2. **Hold and Wait**\n",
    "3. **No Preemption**\n",
    "4. **Circular Wait**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since some resources (like printers or mutex locks) are inherently nonsharable, the mutual exclusion condition typically holds. Thus, prevention schemes focus on eliminating or controlling the other three conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Mutual Exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:**  \n",
    "  Mutual exclusion means that at least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode.  \n",
    "- **Prevention Insight:**  \n",
    "  For sharable resources (e.g., read-only files), multiple processes can access the resource simultaneously. However, many resources—such as a printer or a mutex lock—cannot be shared.  \n",
    "- **Implication:**  \n",
    "  Since some resources are intrinsically nonsharable, mutual exclusion is usually not the target for deadlock prevention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Hold and Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:**  \n",
    "  The hold-and-wait condition occurs when a process holds one or more resources and simultaneously waits for additional resources held by others.  \n",
    "- **Prevention Protocols:**  \n",
    "  Two main protocols can prevent hold and wait:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. **Request All Resources Up Front:**  \n",
    "     A process must request and be allocated all the resources it needs before it begins execution.  \n",
    "     - **Advantage:** Prevents the situation where a process holds one resource while waiting for another.  \n",
    "     - **Disadvantage:** It may lead to poor resource utilization since resources are tied up even when not actively used.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. **Request Resources Only When None Are Held:**  \n",
    "     A process can request resources only when it holds none. If it needs more resources later, it must release all current resources first.  \n",
    "     - **Advantage:** Can lead to better resource utilization.  \n",
    "     - **Disadvantage:** This may cause starvation if the process is repeatedly unable to acquire all needed resources because they are continuously held by others.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Trade-Offs:**  \n",
    "  Both approaches have limitations—either by potentially wasting resources or by increasing the risk of starvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. No Preemption\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:**  \n",
    "  The no-preemption condition means that once a resource is allocated to a process, it cannot be forcibly taken away until the process voluntarily releases it.  \n",
    "- **Prevention Protocol:**  \n",
    "  To counteract this, a protocol can be designed where if a process requests a resource that is not immediately available, all the resources it currently holds are preempted (i.e., forcibly taken away) and added to its wait list. The process is restarted only when it can reacquire both the old and new resources.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Alternative Approach:**  \n",
    "    Check if the requested resources are available. If not, determine whether they are held by a process that is itself waiting for other resources. If so, preempt those resources from the waiting process and allocate them to the requester.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Applicability:**  \n",
    "  This method works best with resources whose state can be saved and restored (such as CPU registers or memory). However, it is typically not suitable for resources like mutex locks or semaphores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Circular Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:**  \n",
    "  Circular wait is when a set of processes is arranged in a circular chain, with each process waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.\n",
    "- **Prevention Protocol:**  \n",
    "  A common solution is to impose a **total ordering** on resource types. This is achieved by:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. **Assigning an Order:**  \n",
    "     Each resource type is given a unique number (using a function F that maps each resource to a natural number).  \n",
    "     For example:\n",
    "     - F(tape drive) = 1  \n",
    "     - F(disk drive) = 5  \n",
    "     - F(printer) = 12\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. **Enforcing Order in Requests:**  \n",
    "     A process can request a resource Rj only if it has already requested (or holds) resources with a lower order than F(Rj). Alternatively, a process must release all resources with an order equal to or higher than F(Rj) before requesting Rj.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Proof of Prevention:**  \n",
    "  If processes follow the increasing order rule, then assuming a circular wait would lead to a contradiction (e.g., F(R₀) < F(R₁) < … < F(Rₙ) < F(R₀)), which is impossible.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Practical Considerations:**  \n",
    "  Tools such as the lock-order verifier \"witness\" (used in some BSD systems) can dynamically check that locks are acquired in the proper order. However, note that a strict ordering may not prevent deadlocks if locks are acquired dynamically in unpredictable patterns—such as in the example of a funds transfer between two accounts where different threads might lock the accounts in different orders.\n",

    "Deadlock prevention aims to ensure that the system never enters a deadlocked state by addressing at least one of the necessary conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutual Exclusion:** Often cannot be eliminated because many resources are inherently nonsharable.\n",
    "- **Hold and Wait:** Can be mitigated by requiring all resources to be requested at once or by allowing requests only when no resources are held.\n",
    "- **No Preemption:** Can be addressed by designing protocols to preempt resources from processes if they cannot obtain additional needed resources immediately.\n",
    "- **Circular Wait:** Can be eliminated by imposing a global order on resource requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method comes with its own set of trade-offs—ranging from decreased resource utilization to potential starvation or the complexity of enforcing a strict resource ordering. Consequently, while these prevention methods can be effective, they often require careful design and are sometimes combined with other strategies (like deadlock detection and recovery) to handle the wide range of resource-allocation scenarios in modern operating systems.\n",

    "## Deadlock Avoidance: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike deadlock prevention—which restricts how processes can request resources to avoid the conditions that lead to deadlocks—deadlock avoidance takes a more flexible approach. It requires additional information about the future resource requests of each process. With this information, the system can decide, at each resource request, whether granting the request will leave the system in a state where a deadlock is impossible. This is achieved by ensuring that the system always remains in a **safe state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Concept of a Safe State\n",
    "\n",
    "A system is said to be in a **safe state** if there exists an ordering (called a safe sequence) of all processes such that each process can be allocated its maximum required resources when it eventually runs. More formally, given the current resource allocations and the maximum demand of each process, the state is safe if:\n",
    "- There is a sequence of processes `<P1, P2, …, Pn>` such that for each process \\(P_i\\), the resources it still needs (its **Need**) can be satisfied by the sum of the available resources and the resources held by all processes \\(P_j\\) with \\(j < i\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "If no such sequence exists, the state is called **unsafe**. Importantly, an unsafe state is not necessarily deadlocked at that moment, but it has the potential to lead to deadlock if further requests are granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Approaches to Deadlock Avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource-Allocation-Graph (RAG) Algorithm:**  \n",
    "   For systems where each resource type has only one instance, the RAG can be extended with *claim edges* (dashed edges representing the maximum possible request). A new request is granted only if converting a claim edge to an assignment edge does not create a cycle. However, this approach does not scale well for systems with multiple instances of each resource type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Banker’s Algorithm:**  \n",
    "   Designed for systems with multiple instances per resource type, the Banker's Algorithm is more general. It is named because it works much like a bank that only allocates cash (resources) if it can always satisfy the needs of all its customers (processes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## In-Depth: Banker's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new process enters the system, it must declare its maximum resource requirement for each resource type. The system maintains several data structures to keep track of resource allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Available:** A vector of length \\( m \\) (number of resource types) indicating how many instances of each resource type are currently available.\n",
    "- **Max:** An \\( n \\times m \\) matrix (with \\( n \\) being the number of processes) where \\( \\text{Max}[i][j] \\) represents the maximum number of instances of resource type \\( R_j \\) that process \\( P_i \\) may request.\n",
    "- **Allocation:** An \\( n \\times m \\) matrix where \\( \\text{Allocation}[i][j] \\) is the number of instances of resource type \\( R_j \\) currently allocated to process \\( P_i \\).\n",
    "- **Need:** An \\( n \\times m \\) matrix defined as \\( \\text{Need}[i][j] = \\text{Max}[i][j] - \\text{Allocation}[i][j] \\); it represents the remaining resources \\( P_i \\) might still request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Safety Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if the system is in a safe state, the Banker's Algorithm uses a **safety algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**  \n",
    "   - Set a vector **Work** to be equal to **Available**.\n",
    "   - Create a boolean vector **Finish** of length \\( n \\), initialized to false for every process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find a Process:**  \n",
    "   - Look for a process \\( P_i \\) such that:\n",
    "     - \\( \\text{Finish}[i] \\) is false, and\n",
    "     - \\( \\text{Need}_i \\leq \\text{Work} \\) (i.e., for every resource type, the need of \\( P_i \\) does not exceed what is currently available in **Work**).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulate Execution:**  \n",
    "   - If such a process is found, simulate that \\( P_i \\) completes its execution by:\n",
    "     - Updating \\( \\text{Work} = \\text{Work} + \\text{Allocation}_i \\).\n",
    "     - Setting \\( \\text{Finish}[i] \\) to true.\n",
    "   - Repeat step 2 until either all processes have finished (which means the system is safe) or no such process can be found (meaning the system is unsafe).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "   - If all entries in **Finish** are true, then the system is in a safe state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Resource-Request Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "When a process \\( P_i \\) makes a resource request represented by vector **Request_i**, the following steps are taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Request Validity:**  \n",
    "   - Verify that \\( \\text{Request}_i \\leq \\text{Need}_i \\). If not, it means the process has exceeded its maximum claim.\n",
    "2. **Check Resource Availability:**  \n",
    "   - Verify that \\( \\text{Request}_i \\leq \\text{Available} \\). If the request exceeds what is available, the process must wait.\n",
    "3. **Tentative Allocation:**  \n",
    "   - Temporarily allocate the requested resources:\n",
    "     - \\( \\text{Available} = \\text{Available} - \\text{Request}_i \\)\n",
    "     - \\( \\text{Allocation}_i = \\text{Allocation}_i + \\text{Request}_i \\)\n",
    "     - \\( \\text{Need}_i = \\text{Need}_i - \\text{Request}_i \\)\n",
    "4. **Safety Check:**  \n",
    "   - Run the safety algorithm with the new tentative state. If the system remains in a safe state, the allocation is made permanent.\n",
    "   - If not, revert to the previous state, and \\( P_i \\) must wait until more resources become available.\n",
